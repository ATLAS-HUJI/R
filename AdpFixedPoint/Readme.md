<b>Adaptive Fixed Point Segmentation Algorithm</b></br>
AdpFixedPoint is a function to perform track segmentation utilizing a first-passage algorithm to determine fixed points where the 
agent/animal has spent a minimum number of observations (obs_min) within a a certain range (adp_rng) of a fixed point that is continuously 
reavaluated.
